# Chartjunk versus Draftsmanship: Lessons from Dürer and Tufte

When I first opened Edward Tufte’s *Visual Explanations*, I was greeted not by a slick chart or a dazzling graphic from the information age, but by Albrecht Dürer’s 1525 woodcut illustration, *Draughtsman drawing a lute*, from his book *Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel un Richtscheyt* (*Instruction on measurement with compass and ruler*).  
It depicts a complex mechanical device designed to aid in drawing objects like a lute using perspective principles.

The illustration shows a draftsman using a *portillon*—a kind of hinged frame, or perspectival window, that allows precise transfer of points—with a grid and a weighted cord to transfer the proportions of a lute onto a drawing surface. An assistant moves the cord to different points on the instrument while the draftsman records the transferred points on paper, constructing a foreshortened image step by step.  

Dürer published designs for four such drawing aids in the 1525 edition of his manual, with the lute drawing being a key example of their application to translate the three-dimensional instrument into a two-dimensional drawing.

## Tufte’s Choice

Starting a book on modern visualisation with an image of a Renaissance workshop apparatus feels oddly anachronistic, but on second thought it makes perfect sense.  

Tufte, often dubbed the *“father of information design”*, has always insisted that clarity of vision and precision of representation have deep roots, and that the best visual explanations are:

> **Timeless rather than trendy.**

Looking closely at Dürer’s illustration, I see more than a draftsman’s trick; I see a metaphor for the fragile bridge between the messy, three-dimensional world and the tidy two-dimensional abstraction we call “data.” 

This is not merely a quaint depiction of Renaissance geometry; it is a parable of translation. To me, it captures the struggle of every technical communicator: how to transmute experience into a drawing, a chart, or a narrative without losing the essence.  

It is at once painstaking and ingenious, a procedure that produces order from chaos—exactly what Tufte celebrates when he praises good visualisations for:

> *“Showing the data.”*

## The Context of Dürer’s Work

This image comes from one of Dürer’s books on geometry, which was not just a draughtsman’s manual but a serious study of measurement—length, area, and volume.  

It was one of Dürer’s most important contributions to the relationship between mathematics and art.  

By choosing this source, Tufte signals that his project is in dialogue with a much older tradition: the effort to systematise vision, to bind numbers and images into a coherent language of explanation.

## Resonances with Tufte’s Philosophy

I find it telling that the image has no colour, no embellishment—just stark lines and patient effort. This austerity resonates with Tufte’s own design philosophy, which strips away “chartjunk” in favour of simplicity.  

I also like the quiet pun in beginning with a picture of a draftsman and apprentice making a picture: Tufte is showing us an illustration *about the making of illustrations*.  

It is a visual *mise en abyme*, a mirror reflecting the very act of explanation.

## A Manifesto in Woodcut

So, the image caught Tufte’s attention—and mine—not just for its historical charm, but for its **statement of purpose**.  

It grounds the book in the long human struggle to see, measure, and explain.  

In contrast to the dazzling data visualisations we might expect, this sober woodcut forces us to pause, to remember that behind every graph is a draftsman, an apprentice, and a perspectival window of sorts: a method of transferring the world faithfully onto paper.  

Beginning with Dürer is, therefore, not antiquarian whimsy, but a **manifesto**:  

> **Visual explanations are a craft, a responsibility, and ultimately, a way of connecting human perception with human understanding and draftsmanship.**

---

## A Reminder for Designers

After seeing this illustration at the opening of Tufte’s book, whenever I feel the urge to add decorative flourishes to a chart *“just to make it pop”*, I’ll remind myself of Dürer’s draftsman, his apprentice, and Tufte himself—who would likely frown and insist that:

> **Beauty lies in truth well drawn.**

And in the careful transfer of reality through a kind of modern *portillon*.
